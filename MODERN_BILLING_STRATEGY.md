# Modern Billing Strategy for Monay
## Simple, Transparent, Scalable

### The Problem with Complex Billing
Traditional usage-based billing is dying because:
- Customers hate unpredictable bills
- Complex calculations reduce trust
- Hard to budget and forecast
- High operational overhead to track everything

### Learning from Modern Winners

#### **Stripe's Model**: Simple % of volume
- 2.9% + $0.30 per successful charge
- Volume discounts at scale
- No monthly fees, no setup fees
- Crystal clear, predictable

#### **Revolut's Model**: Tiered subscriptions
- Free: Basic features, limited usage
- Plus ($3/month): More features, higher limits
- Premium ($8/month): All features, priority support
- Metal ($14/month): Exclusive perks

#### **Wise's Model**: Transparent fee per service
- Fixed fee + % for transfers
- Real exchange rate (no hidden markup)
- See exact fee before confirming

## Monay's Modern Billing Model

### Core Philosophy
**"Pay for value, not for usage"**

### 1. Consumer Wallet: FREE Forever
```yaml
What's Free:
  - Receive money: ✅ Unlimited
  - Send to friends: ✅ Unlimited
  - Store value: ✅ Unlimited
  - Basic debit card: ✅ Virtual card free

What Costs:
  - Cash out to bank: 1% (min $0.25)
  - Physical card: $10 one-time
  - Instant transfers: $0.50
  - International: 2% FX fee

Why It Works:
  - Network effects (more users = more value)
  - Revenue from interchange (0.5-1% from merchants)
  - Float income on stored value
  - Upsell to business accounts
```

### 2. Business Accounts: Value-Based Pricing
```yaml
Starter ($0/month):
  Included:
    - 50 transactions/month
    - 1 user
    - Basic features
  Then: $0.25 per transaction

Growth ($49/month):
  Included:
    - 500 transactions/month
    - 5 users
    - Invoicing
    - API access
  Then: $0.15 per transaction

Scale ($249/month):
  Included:
    - 5,000 transactions/month
    - 25 users
    - Advanced features
    - Priority support
  Then: $0.08 per transaction

Enterprise (Custom):
  - Volume pricing from $0.02/transaction
  - Unlimited users
  - Custom features
  - SLA guarantees
```

### 3. Platform Revenue Streams

#### A. Transaction Revenue (Simple & Transparent)
```javascript
const TRANSACTION_FEES = {
  // Consumer to Consumer: FREE (build network)
  "c2c_transfer": 0,

  // Business receiving: Interchange model
  "card_payment_received": 0.025, // 2.5% (we keep 0.5%)
  "ach_payment_received": 0.008,   // 0.8% (max $5)
  "wire_received": 15,              // Flat $15

  // Withdrawals: Simple percentage
  "instant_withdrawal": 0.015,      // 1.5%
  "standard_withdrawal": 0,         // Free (3-5 days)

  // Cross-border: Transparent markup
  "international_send": 0.02,       // 2% FX + $0.50
  "international_receive": 0        // Free to receive
};
```

#### B. Value-Added Services (Optional)
```javascript
const PREMIUM_SERVICES = {
  // Pay per use - no subscriptions
  "kyc_enhanced": 2.00,           // Only when needed
  "certified_audit_report": 25.00, // On-demand
  "white_label_setup": 500.00,    // One-time
  "api_webhook_priority": 10.00,  // Per month if used

  // Smart contract operations
  "deploy_custom_token": 100.00,  // One-time
  "managed_treasury": 0.001,      // 0.1% AUM annually
};
```

### 4. The USDXM Advantage

**Pay with USDXM, Save 10%**
- All fees reduced by 10% when paid in USDXM
- No conversion fees within ecosystem
- Instant settlement (no T+2 delays)
- Automatic staking rewards (2% APY on balances)

### 5. Radical Simplification

#### What We DON'T Charge For:
- ❌ API calls (within fair use)
- ❌ User seats (except tier limits)
- ❌ Storage (within tier)
- ❌ Login/session time
- ❌ Support tickets
- ❌ Feature access within tier

#### What We DO Charge For:
- ✅ Moving money out of the system
- ✅ Premium speed (instant vs standard)
- ✅ Regulatory services (KYC, compliance)
- ✅ White-label/customization

### 6. Billing Implementation

#### Single Metric That Matters
```sql
-- Not complex computation units
-- Not gas tracking
-- Not API call counting

-- Just simple transaction count + volume
CREATE TABLE billing_metrics_simple (
    tenant_id UUID,
    month DATE,
    transaction_count INTEGER,
    transaction_volume_usd DECIMAL(20,2),
    fees_collected_usd DECIMAL(20,2),

    -- That's it. Simple.
);
```

#### Billing Calculation
```javascript
function calculateMonthlyBill(tenant) {
  const { tier, transactionCount, volume } = tenant;

  // Fixed monthly fee
  let bill = TIER_PRICES[tier].monthly;

  // Overage charges (simple)
  const included = TIER_PRICES[tier].includedTransactions;
  if (transactionCount > included) {
    const overage = transactionCount - included;
    bill += overage * TIER_PRICES[tier].perTransaction;
  }

  // Apply USDXM discount if applicable
  if (tenant.paymentMethod === 'USDXM') {
    bill *= 0.9; // 10% discount
  }

  return bill;
}
```

### 7. Growth Strategy Through Billing

#### Phase 1: Land (Year 1)
- **FREE for consumers** → Build network
- **Generous free tier for SMBs** → Reduce friction
- **Revenue**: Focus on transaction fees only

#### Phase 2: Expand (Year 2)

- **Add value services** → Increase ARPU
- **Revenue**: 70% transactions, 30% subscriptions

#### Phase 3: Monetize (Year 3+)
- **Platform fees on high volume** → Scale revenue
- **Financial products** → Lending, yield, insurance
- **Revenue**: 50% transactions, 30% subscriptions, 20% financial products

### 8. Why This Works

## Summary

### Our Billing Formula:
```
Revenue = (Transaction Volume × Fee %) + (Active Accounts × Tier Price)
```

### Not:
```
Revenue = Σ(CPU_time × Rate) + Σ(Storage × Rate) + Σ(API_calls × Rate) + ...
```

### Key Metrics to Track:
1. **Transaction Volume** (primary)
2. **Active Accounts** (growth)
3. **USDXM Adoption** (efficiency)
4. **Tier Upgrades** (expansion)

That's it. Keep it simple.
