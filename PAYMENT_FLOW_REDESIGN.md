# Payment Flow Redesign - Wallet as Upsell with Enterprise KYC

**Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

The payment flow has been redesigned to position wallet creation as an **optional upsell** after payment method selection, with enterprise KYC inheritance for frictionless onboarding.

## New Flow Architecture

### Previous Flow (Problematic)
1. View payment request
2. Create wallet first â†’ Empty wallet!
3. Fund wallet with traditional rails
4. Pay with stablecoins

**Problem:** Required creating a wallet before having any money to put in it.

### New Flow (Optimized)
1. **View payment request** - Amount, account, due date
2. **Select payment method first** - All 9 methods visible (traditional + digital wallets)
3. **Wallet creation upsell** - Side-by-side comparison:
   - Left: Pay directly (standard flow)
   - Right: Create wallet & pay (same payment + future benefits)
4. **Complete payment** - With or without wallet creation
5. **Confirmation** - Receipt + wallet details (if created)

## Key Improvements

### 1. Payment Methods First
- **All 9 payment methods shown initially:**
  - Traditional: eCheck, Debit/Credit Card
  - Digital Wallets: Apple Pay, Google Pay, Venmo, PayPal
  - Future: Stablecoins (USDC, USDT, PYUSD) - for existing wallet holders

### 2. Enterprise KYC Inheritance
- **No duplicate KYC required**
- Enterprise (e.g., Acme Corporation) has already verified the customer
- Customer grants consent for KYC sharing with Monay
- Instant wallet creation using enterprise-verified identity

### 3. Value Proposition Clarity
Side-by-side comparison shows:

**Pay Direct:**
- One-time payment
- Standard processing fees
- No future benefits

**Create Wallet & Pay:**
- Same payment amount
- Same payment method
- $0.25 loyalty credit immediately
- Future payments: instant + low fees
- No additional KYC needed (verified by enterprise)
- Wallet credentials sent to email on file

## Technical Implementation

### URL Parameters (Enhanced)

```
/pay?
  accountNumber=ACC-123456
  &firstName=John
  &lastName=Doe
  &amountDue=1250
  &dueDate=2025-12-31
  &email=john@acme.com                    // NEW: Customer email
  &organizationName=Acme Corporation      // NEW: Enterprise name
```

**Default values if omitted:**
- `email`: defaults to `ali@monay.com`
- `organizationName`: defaults to `Acme Corporation`

### Payment Request JSON Structure

```typescript
interface PaymentRequestData {
  accountNumber: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  amountDue: number;
  dueDate: string;
  email?: string;                    // NEW
  enterpriseKYC?: {                  // NEW
    verified: boolean;
    verificationLevel: 'tier1' | 'tier2';
    employeeId?: string;
    organizationId?: string;
    organizationName?: string;
  };
}
```

### Wallet Types

Three wallet options available:

1. **Ephemeral Wallet**
   - Active for 24 hours
   - No ongoing commitment
   - Instant setup
   - $0.25 loyalty credit

2. **Persistent Wallet** (Recommended)
   - Permanent account
   - Save payment methods
   - Transaction history
   - $0.25 loyalty credit
   - Future instant payments

3. **Adaptive Wallet**
   - Start temporary, upgrade later
   - Smart limits
   - $0.25 loyalty credit
   - Best of both worlds

## User Journey
