### 3. Backend API Testing (Port 3001)

#### Treasury Endpoints
```bash
# Test treasury initialization
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/enterprise-treasury/initialize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"walletAddress": "SolTEST123"}'

# Test invoice creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/enterprise-treasury/invoice/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "recipient_id": "1",
    "amount": 100.00,
    "due_date": "2024-12-31",
    "description": "Test invoice",
    "line_items": [
      {"description": "Service", "quantity": 1, "unit_price": 100}
    ]
  }'

# Test invoice payment
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/enterprise-treasury/invoice/pay \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "invoice_id": "1",
    "amount": 100.00,
    "provider": "tempo"
  }'
```

#### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check treasury created
SELECT * FROM enterprise_treasuries;

-- Check invoices
SELECT * FROM invoices ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check payments
SELECT * FROM invoice_payments;

-- Check customer credits
SELECT * FROM customer_credits WHERE status = 'AVAILABLE';

-- Verify audit trail
SELECT * FROM invoice_events ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### 4. Integration Testing

#### End-to-End Invoice Flow
1. [ ] Enterprise creates invoice
2. [ ] Consumer receives invoice notification
3. [ ] Consumer pays invoice
4. [ ] Enterprise sees payment in dashboard
5. [ ] Both see updated transaction history

#### P2P Request Flow
1. [ ] User A creates payment request with reason
2. [ ] User B receives request notification
3. [ ] User B pays request
4. [ ] Both see transaction with audit tag
5. [ ] Verify reason appears in history

#### Provider Swap Testing
1. [ ] Create invoice with Tempo
2. [ ] Swap treasury balance to Circle
3. [ ] Verify swap appears in history
4. [ ] Create invoice with Circle
5. [ ] Verify both providers work

---

### 5. Performance Testing

#### Load Testing
```bash
# Create 100 invoices
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/enterprise-treasury/invoice/create \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
    -d "{\"recipient_id\": \"1\", \"amount\": $((RANDOM % 1000)), \"due_date\": \"2024-12-31\"}"
done
```

#### Response Times
- [ ] Invoice creation < 500ms
- [ ] Invoice list load < 200ms
- [ ] Payment processing < 1000ms
- [ ] Dashboard load < 300ms

---

### 6. Security Testing

#### Authentication
