# Capital Markets Enhancement Plan for Business Rule Engine

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the comprehensive enhancement plan to enable the Monay Business Rule Engine to support capital markets operations with hybrid rule sets. The implementation will allow deployment of multiple categories of rules (TOKEN, COMPLIANCE, TRANSACTION, SECURITY, WALLET) in coordinated smart contracts for securities trading, settlement, and regulatory compliance.

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ Business Rule Engine supports multiple rule categories
- ✅ Rule compiler can group rules by category
- ✅ Smart contract generation includes all rules in one deployment
- ⚠️ UI lacks multi-rule selection and deployment
- ⚠️ No predefined capital markets templates
- ⚠️ Missing rule dependency management
- ⚠️ No specialized capital markets components

## Implementation Phases (Prioritized)

### 🔴 Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1) - CRITICAL
**Goal:** Establish foundational database and backend support for rule sets

#### Database Enhancements
- [ ] Create `rule_sets` table
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE rule_sets (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    category VARCHAR(50),
    instrument_type VARCHAR(50),
    created_by UUID,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    deployed_at TIMESTAMP,
    contract_address VARCHAR(255),
    chain VARCHAR(50),
    status VARCHAR(50)
  );
  ```

- [ ] Create `rule_set_items` table
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE rule_set_items (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    rule_set_id UUID REFERENCES rule_sets(id),
    rule_id UUID,
    order_index INTEGER,
    is_required BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
  );
  ```

- [ ] Create `rule_dependencies` table
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE rule_dependencies (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    rule_id UUID,
    depends_on_rule_id UUID,
    dependency_type VARCHAR(50)
  );
  ```

#### Backend Services
- [ ] Create `/monay-backend-common/src/services/capital-markets/RuleSetService.js`
- [ ] Enhance `BusinessRuleEngine.js` with `deployRuleSet()` method
- [ ] Add rule dependency resolver in `RuleEvaluator.js`

### 🔴 Phase 2: API Layer (Week 1) - CRITICAL
**Goal:** Provide endpoints for rule set management

#### New Routes
- [ ] POST `/api/capital-markets/rule-sets` - Create rule set
- [ ] GET `/api/capital-markets/rule-sets` - List rule sets
- [ ] GET `/api/capital-markets/rule-sets/:id` - Get rule set details
- [ ] POST `/api/capital-markets/rule-sets/:id/deploy` - Deploy rule set to blockchain
- [ ] POST `/api/capital-markets/rule-sets/:id/rules` - Add rules to set
- [ ] DELETE `/api/capital-markets/rule-sets/:id/rules/:ruleId` - Remove rule from set

#### Route Implementation
```javascript
// /monay-backend-common/src/routes/capital-markets.js
router.post('/rule-sets', authMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  const { name, description, instrument_type, rule_ids } = req.body;
  // Implementation
});

router.post('/rule-sets/:id/deploy', authMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  const { chain, options } = req.body;
  const ruleSet = await RuleSetService.getRuleSet(req.params.id);
  const result = await BusinessRuleEngine.deployRuleSet(ruleSet, chain, options);
  // Return deployment result
});
```

### 🟡 Phase 3: Capital Markets Templates (Week 2) - HIGH PRIORITY
**Goal:** Create predefined rule templates for common capital markets scenarios

#### Template Service
- [ ] Create `/monay-backend-common/src/services/capital-markets/CapitalMarketsTemplates.js`

#### Predefined Templates
- [ ] **Equity Trading Template**
  - Accredited investor verification
  - Trading hours enforcement (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST)
  - Pattern day trader rules
  - Reg T margin requirements
  - Short sale restrictions

- [ ] **Fixed Income Template**
  - Qualified institutional buyer checks
  - Minimum denomination rules
  - Accrued interest calculations
  - Settlement T+1/T+2 rules

- [ ] **Private Securities Template**
  - Reg D compliance (506b/506c)
  - Lock-up period enforcement
  - Transfer restrictions
  - Qualified purchaser verification

- [ ] **Derivatives Template**
  - Options exercise rules
  - Margin requirements
  - Position limits
  - Expiration handling

### 🟡 Phase 4: Frontend Components (Week 2) - HIGH PRIORITY
**Goal:** Build UI for capital markets rule management

#### New Components
- [ ] `/src/components/capital-markets/RuleSetBuilder.tsx`
  ```tsx
  interface RuleSetBuilderProps {
    onSave: (ruleSet: RuleSet) => void;
    templates: CapitalMarketTemplate[];
  }
  ```

- [ ] `/src/components/capital-markets/RuleSetDeployment.tsx`
  ```tsx
  interface DeploymentProps {
    ruleSet: RuleSet;
    onDeploy: (chain: string, options: DeployOptions) => void;
  }
  ```

- [ ] `/src/components/capital-markets/MultiRuleSelector.tsx`
  ```tsx
  interface MultiRuleSelectorProps {
    availableRules: Rule[];
    selectedRules: Rule[];
    onSelectionChange: (rules: Rule[]) => void;
  }
  ```

#### Enhanced Existing Components
- [ ] Update `EnhancedBusinessRulesEngine.tsx`:
  - Add "Create Rule Set" button
  - Add bulk rule selection checkboxes
  - Add "Deploy Selected Rules" action
  - Show rule categories with different colors
  - Add filter by multiple categories

### 🟢 Phase 5: Rule Validation & Dependencies (Week 3) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Goal:** Ensure rule sets are valid and handle dependencies

#### Validation Service
- [ ] Create `/monay-backend-common/src/services/capital-markets/RuleValidator.js`

#### Validation Rules
- [ ] Validate no circular dependencies
- [ ] Ensure required rules are included
- [ ] Check for conflicting rules
- [ ] Verify category compatibility
- [ ] Validate priority ordering

#### Dependency Resolution
```javascript
class RuleDependencyResolver {
  resolveDependencies(rules) {
    // Topological sort for execution order
    // Detect circular dependencies
    // Return ordered rule list
  }
}
```

### 🟢 Phase 6: Smart Contract Enhancements (Week 3) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Goal:** Optimize contracts for capital markets

#### Contract Templates
- [ ] Create `/contracts/CapitalMarketsRuleEngine.sol`
```solidity
contract CapitalMarketsRuleEngine {
    struct SecurityRule {
        uint256 id;
        bytes32 category;
        uint8 priority;
        bytes condition;
        bytes action;
    }

    mapping(bytes32 => SecurityRule[]) public rulesByCategory;

    function evaluateTransaction(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        string memory instrumentType
    ) public view returns (bool, string memory);
}
```

- [ ] Add gas optimization for large rule sets
- [ ] Implement batch rule updates
- [ ] Add emergency circuit breaker

### 🟢 Phase 7: Testing & Documentation (Week 4) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Goal:** Ensure reliability and usability

#### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for RuleSetService
- [ ] Integration tests for multi-rule deployment
- [ ] Load tests with 100+ rules
- [ ] Capital markets scenario tests

#### Documentation
- [ ] API documentation for new endpoints
- [ ] User guide for capital markets features
- [ ] Template usage examples
- [ ] Best practices guide

### 🔵 Phase 8: Advanced Features (Week 5-6) - NICE TO HAVE
**Goal:** Enhanced functionality for sophisticated use cases

#### Advanced Features
- [ ] Rule versioning and rollback
- [ ] A/B testing for rules
- [ ] Real-time rule performance metrics
- [ ] Machine learning rule optimization
- [ ] Cross-chain rule synchronization

#### Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Rule effectiveness dashboard
- [ ] Compliance score tracking
- [ ] Transaction approval rates
- [ ] Rule violation analytics
