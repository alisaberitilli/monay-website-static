# Monay Enterprise Wallet - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for all missing functionality in the Monay Enterprise Wallet application. Each page will be built with mock data initially, then integrated with the monay-backend-common API.

## Navigation Pattern
- Each action opens a modal or navigates to a detail page
- All detail pages have a "Back" button to return to parent
- Use React Router for navigation
- Modal states managed with Zustand or component state

## Technical Approach

### State Management
- Use Zustand for global state
- React Query for API data fetching
- Local state for forms and modals

### Routing
- React Router v6 for navigation
- Dynamic routes for detail pages
- Protected routes based on user roles

### Component Structure
```
/components
  /modals
    - TransactionDetailModal.tsx
    - CreateInvoiceModal.tsx
    - TransferModal.tsx
  /forms
    - TokenCreationForm.tsx
    - CardCreationForm.tsx
    - RuleBuilderForm.tsx
  /pages
    - InvoiceDetailPage.tsx
    - TokenDetailPage.tsx
    - CardDetailPage.tsx
```

### Mock Data Structure
- Create `/lib/mock-data` directory
- Separate files for each entity
- Realistic data with proper types
- Support pagination and filtering

### API Integration Points
All endpoints will connect to `http://localhost:3001/api/v1/`:
- `/transactions` - Transaction CRUD
- `/invoices` - Invoice management
- `/tokens` - Token operations
- `/cards` - Card management
- `/compliance` - KYC/AML operations
- `/rules` - Business rules CRUD
- `/analytics` - Analytics data
- `/treasury` - Treasury operations

## Success Criteria
- All buttons and actions have working functionality
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Responsive design for all components
- Dark mode support throughout
- Accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Performance: <200ms response time for user actions
