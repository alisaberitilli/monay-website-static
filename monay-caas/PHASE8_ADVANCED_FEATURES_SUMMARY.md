---

## 📈 Adoption Strategy

### For WebSocket Features
1. Enable for power users first
2. Monitor performance impact
3. Gradually increase usage
4. Implement fallback mechanisms
5. Scale infrastructure as needed

### For PWA Installation
1. Show install prompt after engagement
2. Highlight offline benefits
3. Offer installation incentives
4. Track installation metrics
5. Optimize based on data

---

## 🔄 Migration Path

### From Polling to WebSocket
```typescript
// Before: Polling
setInterval(() => fetchData(), 5000);

// After: WebSocket
useTransactionUpdates((data) => updateState(data));
```

### From Web to PWA
```typescript
// Add PWA support
const { installPWA, isInstallable } = usePWA();
// Show install prompt when appropriate
```

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### WebSocket Limitations
- Browser connection limits (6 per domain)
- Proxy/firewall compatibility
- Mobile background restrictions
- Scaling requires Redis

### PWA Limitations
- iOS limitations (no install prompt)
- Background sync restrictions
- Storage quotas
- Update lag time
