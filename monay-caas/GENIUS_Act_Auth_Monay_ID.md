## üìù Notes for Implementation Team

### Critical Considerations
1. **All authentication flows must be implemented in Monay-ID**, not in the main platform
2. **GENIUS Act deadline is non-negotiable** - July 18, 2025
3. **Login.gov and ID.me are mandatory** for federal compliance
4. **Offline capability is required** for disaster scenarios
5. **Multi-channel verification is required** (can't rely on single method)

### Integration Points
- Main Monay platform will call Monay-ID APIs
- Monay-ID handles all authentication/authorization
- Session tokens are shared via secure API
- Audit logs must be centralized
- Real-time status updates via webhooks

### Security Requirements
- All data in transit must be encrypted (TLS 1.3)
- All data at rest must be encrypted (AES-256)
- PII must be tokenized in main platform
- Biometric data must never leave Monay-ID
- Compliance with zero-trust architecture
