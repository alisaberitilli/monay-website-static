## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture
```javascript
// Core Service Structure
AuditLogService {
  - log()           // Log events with integrity hash
  - query()         // Advanced querying with filters
  - archiveLogs()   // Automatic retention management
  - verifyIntegrity() // Hash-based verification
}

// Middleware Pipeline
auditMiddleware -> auditAction -> auditCompliance -> auditSecurity
```

### Database Schema
```sql
AuditLogs {
  id: UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  userId: UUID,
  tenantId: UUID,
  action: STRING,
  resource: STRING,
  severity: ENUM,
  category: ENUM,
  hash: STRING,
  timestamp: TIMESTAMP,
  -- Multiple composite indexes for performance
}
```

### Event Categories
- **AUTHENTICATION**: Login, logout, MFA events
- **AUTHORIZATION**: Permission changes, access control
- **FINANCIAL**: Transactions, payments, transfers
- **COMPLIANCE**: KYC, AML, regulatory checks
- **SECURITY**: Threats, attacks, suspicious activity
- **SYSTEM**: Configuration, maintenance, updates
- **USER_MANAGEMENT**: Account creation, updates, deletion

### Severity Levels
- 🔵 **DEBUG**: Development and troubleshooting
- 🟢 **INFO**: Normal operations
- 🟡 **WARNING**: Potential issues
- 🔴 **ERROR**: Operation failures
- 🔴🔴 **CRITICAL**: System-critical events
- 🟣 **SECURITY**: Security-related events

## 📚 Usage Examples

### Logging an Event
```javascript
const { auditLogService, AuditActions } = require('./audit-log');

await auditLogService.log({
  userId: user.id,
  action: AuditActions.TRANSACTION_INITIATED,
  resource: 'wallet',
  resourceId: wallet.id,
  details: { amount: 1000, currency: 'USD' },
  severity: 'INFO',
  category: 'FINANCIAL'
});
```

### Using Middleware
```javascript
// Automatic API logging
app.use(auditMiddleware());

// Specific action logging
router.post('/transfer', 
  auditAction('TRANSFER_INITIATED'),
  transferController
);

// Compliance logging
router.post('/kyc',
  auditCompliance('KYC_CHECK'),
  kycController
);
```

### Frontend Integration
```tsx
import { AuditLogViewer } from '@/components/AuditLogViewer';

<AuditLogViewer 
  userId={currentUser.id}
  showSecurityEvents={true}
/>
```

## 🔄 Migration Path

### From Existing System
1. Deploy new audit system in parallel
2. Start logging new events
3. Import historical data if needed
4. Verify integrity of imported data
5. Switch to new system
6. Archive old audit logs

2. **Query Performance**: Complex queries may be slow without proper indexing
3. **Real-time Streaming**: Currently batch-based, not true real-time
4. **Cross-Region**: Requires replication setup for multi-region
