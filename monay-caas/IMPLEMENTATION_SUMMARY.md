## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Pattern
```
Frontend (Next.js 14)
    ↓
API Layer (Express.js)
    ↓
Service Layer (Business Logic)
    ↓
Database (PostgreSQL)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Invoice Created** → Triggers wallet generation option
2. **Mode Selection** → AI analyzes transaction parameters
3. **Wallet Generation** → Quantum keys + blockchain addresses
4. **Lifecycle Management** → Real-time monitoring & auto-destruction
5. **Compliance Proofs** → Zero-knowledge verification

### Storage Strategy
- **Production**: PostgreSQL with encrypted key storage
- **Development**: LocalStorage for rapid prototyping
- **Caching**: Redis for real-time countdown sync
