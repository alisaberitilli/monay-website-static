## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### TOTP Implementation
```javascript
// Using speakeasy library for TOTP
{
  algorithm: 'SHA1',
  digits: 6,
  period: 30,
  window: 2
}
```

### Encryption Scheme
```javascript
// AES-256-GCM for secret encryption
{
  algorithm: 'aes-256-gcm',
  keyDerivation: 'scrypt',
  ivLength: 16 bytes,
  authTag: included
}
```

### Rate Limiting
```javascript
// Protection against brute force
{
  maxAttempts: 5,
  lockoutDuration: 15 minutes,
  windowSize: 15 minutes
}
```

### High-Risk Actions Requiring MFA
- Large financial transfers
- Password changes
- Adding beneficiaries
- Disabling MFA
- Exporting private keys
- Account deletion
- Email changes
- API key creation

  onComplete={() => console.log('MFA enabled')}
  onCancel={() => console.log('Setup cancelled')}
/>
```

### Requiring MFA for Routes
```javascript
// Protect sensitive endpoints
router.post('/api/transfer',
  authenticate,
  requireMFA({ action: 'TRANSFER_LARGE_AMOUNT' }),
  transferController
);

// Step-up authentication
router.delete('/api/account',
  authenticate,
  stepUpAuth({ maxAge: 5 * 60 * 1000 }),
  deleteAccountController
);
```

### Verifying MFA
```tsx
import { MFAVerification } from '@/components/MFASetup';

<MFAVerification
  action="Transfer $10,000"
  onVerified={(token) => proceedWithTransfer(token)}
  onCancel={() => cancelOperation()}
/>
```
