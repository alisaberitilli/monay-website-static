# Tenant Frontend Implementation - Complete

## Implementation Date: January 29, 2025

## Overview
Successfully implemented the complete tenant-organization-user hierarchy across frontend applications, ensuring proper account type selection and registration flows for consumer, business, and enterprise users.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Consumer Wallet Registration UI
**Location**: `/monay-cross-platform/web/app/auth/register-with-account-type/page.tsx`

#### Features Implemented:
- **Account Type Selection**:
  - Individual/Personal accounts (direct tenant relationship)
  - Small Business accounts (organization-based tenant)
  - Enterprise accounts (join existing organization)

- **Dynamic Form Fields**:
  - Individual: Standard user fields only
  - Business: Additional business name field
  - Enterprise: Organization ID or invite code field

- **Visual Design**:
  - Card-based selection with icons (User, Briefcase, Building)
  - Responsive layout with mobile optimization
  - Smooth transitions between account types
  - Clear descriptions for each option

### 2. AuthContext Enhancement
**Location**: `/monay-cross-platform/web/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

#### Updates Made:
- **Dynamic Endpoint Selection**:
  ```typescript
  // Automatically routes to correct endpoint based on user type
  - /api/auth/register/consumer (Individual)
  - /api/auth/register/business (Small Business)
  - /api/auth/register/enterprise (Enterprise)
  ```

- **Enhanced Registration Data**:
  - Support for businessName field
  - Support for organizationId and inviteCode
  - Automatic userType assignment based on selection

### 3. API Configuration
**Location**: `/monay-cross-platform/web/lib/api-config.ts`

#### New Endpoints Added:
```typescript
AUTH: {
  SIGNUP_CONSUMER: '/auth/register/consumer',
  SIGNUP_BUSINESS: '/auth/register/business',
  SIGNUP_ENTERPRISE: '/auth/register/enterprise',
}

USER: {
  CONTEXT: '/user/context',
  SWITCH_TENANT: '/user/switch-tenant',
}
```

### 4. Backend Validation
**Location**: `/monay-backend-common/src/validations/account-validator.js`

#### Schema Updates:
- Added support for tenant-related fields:
  - userType (individual/business/enterprise)
  - accountType (consumer/small_business/enterprise)
  - businessName, organizationName
  - organizationId, inviteCode
  - Transformation fields (first_name, last_name)

## Registration Flow

### Individual Consumer Flow
1. User selects "Individual/Personal" account type
2. Fills standard registration form (name, email, phone, password)
3. System creates:
   - User record with type='individual'
   - Individual tenant with direct relationship
   - Entry in tenant_users table

### Small Business Flow
1. User selects "Small Business" account type
2. Fills enhanced form including business name
3. System creates:
   - User record with type='business'
   - Organization record for the business
   - Tenant linked to organization
   - Entry in organization_users table (NOT tenant_users)

### Enterprise Flow
1. User selects "Enterprise" account type
2. Provides organization ID or invite code
3. System creates:
   - User record with type='enterprise'
   - Links user to existing organization
   - No new tenant (uses organization's existing tenant)

## Testing Results

### Test Script Created
**Location**: `/monay-backend-common/test-tenant-flow.sh`

Features:
- Tests all three registration endpoints
- Verifies tenant context retrieval
- Checks database state
- Color-coded output for easy reading

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Current state shows proper separation:
Individual Consumers: 2 users with direct tenant relationships
Business Users: 0 (ready for new registrations)
Organizations: 0 (ready for tenant assignment)
```

## URL Access Points

### Consumer Wallet
- **Registration Page**: http://localhost:3003/auth/register-with-account-type
- **Standard Registration**: http://localhost:3003/auth/register (original)
- **Login**: http://localhost:3003/auth/login

### Admin Portal
- **Organizations**: http://localhost:3002/organizations
- **New Organization**: http://localhost:3002/organizations/new
- **Tenant Management**: (Available in navigation)

### Enterprise Wallet
- **Invoice Analytics**: http://localhost:3007/invoices/analytics
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:3007/dashboard

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Individual consumers: Direct tenant relationship via tenant_users
- ALL businesses: Organization-based relationship (including small businesses)
- No organization users in tenant_users table (enforced by database trigger)

### 2. Frontend Routing
- Smart endpoint selection based on user type
- Backward compatibility with existing /auth/register endpoint
- Enhanced registration page as opt-in feature

### 3. Validation Strategy
- Extended validation schema to support new fields
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Optional fields for gradual migration

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
1. **Authentication Flow**: Seamlessly integrated with JWT-based auth
2. **User Context**: Tenant context available on all authenticated requests
3. **Database**: Properly uses existing tables and relationships
4. **API**: RESTful endpoints following existing patterns

### Frontend Components
- Reuses existing form components
- Maintains consistent styling with TailwindCSS
- Compatible with existing AuthContext consumers

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Proper Multi-Tenancy
- Clear isolation boundaries
- Correct hierarchy implementation
- Row-level security ready

### 2. User Experience
- Clear account type selection
- Appropriate fields for each user type
- Smooth registration process

### 3. Maintainability
- Clean separation of user types
- Consistent patterns across codebase
- Well-documented relationships

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Add visual feedback for registration success
2. Implement invite code validation for enterprise users
3. Add organization selection dropdown for enterprise users

### Short-term
1. Create tenant switching UI for multi-tenant users
2. Add organization management UI in admin portal
3. Implement tenant-specific dashboards

### Long-term
1. Add billing integration per tenant
2. Implement usage analytics by tenant
3. Create tenant-specific customization options

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Registration fails with validation errors**
   - Ensure all required fields are provided
   - Check that phone numbers include country code
   - Verify password meets requirements

2. **Tenant not created for new users**
   - Check user_type is correctly set
   - Verify tenant creation logic in user repository
   - Check database triggers aren't blocking creation

3. **Users can't access their tenant context**
   - Ensure authentication token is valid
   - Check tenant middleware is running
   - Verify user-tenant relationships in database

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check tenant summary
psql -U alisaberi -d monay -c "SELECT * FROM tenant_summary;"

# View user hierarchy
psql -U alisaberi -d monay -c "SELECT * FROM tenant_hierarchy_view;"

# Test registration endpoints
./test-tenant-flow.sh
```
