## 🛡️ DATABASE SAFETY COMPLIANCE

### Safety Measures Implemented:
1. ✅ **No DROP operations** - All tables use CREATE IF NOT EXISTS
2. ✅ **No DELETE operations** - Replaced with soft deletes (status updates)
3. ✅ **No TRUNCATE operations** - Never used
4. ✅ **No CASCADE DELETE** - Removed from foreign key constraints
5. ✅ **Soft Delete Pattern** - Archive old records instead of deletion
6. ✅ **Status-based cleanup** - Mark as 'archived' instead of removing

### Compliance Changes Made:
- Removed `ON DELETE CASCADE` from payment_schedules table
- Replaced `DELETE FROM payment_retry_queue` with UPDATE to 'archived' status
- Added 'archived' status to retry queue status enum
- Confirmed CLAUDE.md has comprehensive database safety rules
