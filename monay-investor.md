# Invest in Monay

**Building the programmable money stack for the real world — with accuracy first.**  
Wallet‑as‑a‑Service (WaaS) · Coin‑as‑a‑Service (CaaS) · High‑assurance Identity (Monay ID)

> **Status Disclosure (Sept 2, 2025):** Monay ID ~**78%** complete; CaaS ~**48%** complete; WaaS (MVP) ~**66%** complete. **Audits, certifications/registrations, partner integrations, and regression testing are pending.** Feature availability varies by program, tier, and region.

## The one‑liner
Monay is **building** a single platform where institutions can **issue a branded stablecoin** and **run controlled wallets** that work in everyday contexts (tap‑to‑pay, e‑commerce, and planned cash access) — with **policy, compliance, and identity** tied to every transaction.

> *We are not a bank or licensed money transmitter. Product capabilities described below include items in development and subject to change.*

---

## Why now
- **Programs need rails, not toolkits.** Agencies, utilities, healthcare, and enterprises are moving refunds, benefits, and stipends to digital. Monay aims to deliver **ready-to-run money movement** instead of SDK-only blocks.
- **Policy tailwinds.** U.S. initiatives around digital disbursements, education funding, and workforce stipends increase demand for **controlled spending** and **auditability**.
- **Real-world acceptance.** Users expect to **tap, shop, or withdraw cash** without learning crypto. Monay abstracts chain complexity and ties spend to program rules.

## What we’re building
**WaaS + CaaS + ID (one contract, one API) — in development:**
- **Controlled wallets for everyday spend (WaaS):** Card issuing with just‑in‑time funding (planned), **cash access via cardless ATM** (planned), MCC/merchant/geo/time limits, refunds/returns/partials, multi‑role wallets (guardian/beneficiary, employee/department).  
- **Branded stablecoin issuance (CaaS):** Program treasuries, fiat↔stablecoin conversion, scheduled settlements, **cross‑rail rebalancing** (prototype).  
- **Monay ID (enterprise identification & authentication):** WebAuthn/passkeys, multi‑modal biometrics (where device capabilities permit), adaptive MFA, **custodian‑assisted recovery** (multi‑sig/time‑lock), SSO/SAML/OIDC, risk scoring, audit logs.  
- **Invoice First™ flows:** Every transaction tied to a verified invoice for enterprise‑grade reconciliation and audits.  

> **Stablecoin note:** The platform is **designed to support USDM and major stablecoins** at the treasury layer, with the goal of interoperability. Actual asset support and counterparties will be announced upon completion of required reviews and agreements.

## How we’re different (design principles)
1. **Dual‑rail architecture** targeting Base L2 + Solana (with optional alternatives for pilots).  
2. **Unified WaaS + CaaS** so wallet policy and coin treasury share one source of truth.  
3. **Program‑grade BRF**: eligibility, KYC/KYB, spend controls (MCC/merchant, geo/time), approvals, automated clawbacks.  
4. **Everyday acceptance focus**: cards and cash access as first‑class product paths (partnerships pending).  
5. **Invoice First™**: built around invoices/line items, not just transfers.  
6. **Compliance orchestration**: sanctions/AML checks, auditable trails, and segregation (FBO/escrow) patterns.  
7. **Hybrid ledger + on‑chain anchoring**: reporting speed with verifiable history.  
8. **Treasury automation**: segregation, conversion, rebalancing (prototype).  
9. **Multi‑stakeholder wallets**: roles, allowances, and spend envelopes for real programs.  
10. **Built‑in engagement (Nudge)** for onboarding, OTP, statements, reminders.  
11. **Enterprise hooks**: SSO/SAML, RBAC, webhooks, exports, ACH/RTP/wires connectors (as integrations are validated).  
12. **Accessibility**: WCAG‑aligned UIs, voice OTP options; recovery that works for seniors and students.

> **No partnership claims.** We will only publicize partner names/logos after agreements are executed and live.

## Use cases we aim to serve
- **Public programs:** stipends, benefits, disaster relief, school funds — with merchant restrictions and auditable trails.  
- **Utilities & billers:** refunds/credits, deposits, collections, with statementing and dunning.  
- **Healthcare & payers:** member wallets, prior‑auth spend, HIPAA‑aligned patterns.  
- **Enterprises:** controlled employee spend, vendor payouts, rebates/loyalty.
