2. Provider failover testing
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Security auditing
5. Documentation updates
```

---

## 📅 SYNCHRONIZATION POINTS

### Daily Standups (15 min)
- Each team reports blockers
- API contract updates
- Dependency announcements

### Week 1 Checkpoint
- Backend: Circle removed, providers stubbed
- Frontend: UI mockups complete
- Integration: Test environment ready

### Week 2 Checkpoint
- Backend: All providers integrated
- Frontend: Connected to real APIs
- Integration: E2E tests passing

### Week 3: Final Integration
- All teams: Feature freeze
- Integration: Full system testing
- Documentation: Complete

---

## 🔄 CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Backend Core] --> B[Admin UI]
    A --> C[Enterprise UI]
    A --> D[Consumer UI]
    B --> E[Integration Tests]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```

1. **Backend MUST complete**:
   - Provider clients (Week 1)
   - API endpoints (Week 1)
   - WebSocket events (Week 1)

2. **Frontend teams CAN work with**:
   - Mock data initially
   - Gradually integrate real APIs
   - Feature flags for provider switching

---

## 🎯 MINIMAL REGRESSION APPROACH

### DO NOT TOUCH (Unless Necessary):
```javascript
// Already working - leave alone:
- Invoice-First core logic
- Business Rule Engine
- WebSocket infrastructure
- Database schema (only additions)
- Authentication/Authorization
- Existing API contracts
```

### SAFE TO MODIFY:
```javascript
// Can be changed without breaking:
- Circle service calls → BitGo/Tempo
- Provider configurations
- UI components (backwards compatible)
- New API endpoints (additive)
```

### MIGRATION STRATEGY:
```javascript
// Use feature flags:
if (process.env.USE_MONAYPAY === 'true') {
  // New MonayPay flow
  router = new RouterV2();
} else {
  // Legacy flow (temporary)
  router = new LegacyRouter();
}
```

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Circle Dependencies** | 0 | `grep -r "circle" src/` |
| **Provider Uptime** | 99.9% | Health check dashboard |
| **API Response Time** | <200ms | Performance monitoring |
| **Test Coverage** | >80% | Jest coverage reports |
| **Invoice-to-Payment** | <30s | E2E test timing |

---

## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION

### If Backend Delayed:
- Frontend uses extended mocks
- Deploy with feature flags disabled
- Gradual rollout per provider

### If Provider APIs Unavailable:
- Use sandbox/test environments
- Build comprehensive mocks
- Document assumptions

### If Integration Issues:
- Rollback capability ready
- Database backup before migration
- Feature flags for quick disable

2. **Remove Circle Completely** - No compromise on this
3. **Test Early and Often** - Integration issues compound
4. **Communicate Blockers** - Don't wait for standups
5. **Document Everything** - APIs, configs, decisions
