  async request<T>(endpoint: string, options?: RequestOptions): Promise<T> {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseURL}${endpoint}`, {
      ...options,
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.getToken()}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        ...options?.headers
      }
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new APIError(response.status, await response.text());
    }

    return response.json();
  }
}
```

### Database Schema Extensions

```sql
-- Super App Service Tables
CREATE TABLE service_categories (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  icon VARCHAR(100),
  order_index INTEGER,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

CREATE TABLE user_services (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  service_id UUID REFERENCES services(id),
  settings JSONB,
  last_used TIMESTAMP,
  is_favorite BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);

CREATE TABLE travel_bookings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  type VARCHAR(20), -- 'flight', 'hotel', 'train', etc.
  booking_data JSONB,
  status VARCHAR(20),
  amount DECIMAL(15,2),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
