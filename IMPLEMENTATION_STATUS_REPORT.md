## 💡 Key Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Stop all feature development** - Focus on core infrastructure
2. **Implement authentication** - Cannot proceed without user auth
3. **Build organization management** - Required for all operations
4. **Create component library** - Standardize UI development
5. **Complete KYC/AML workflow** - Regulatory requirement

### Strategic Decisions Needed
1. **Mobile Strategy**: Native vs. Progressive Web App?
2. **Authentication Provider**: Continue with Monay-ID or implement direct?
3. **UI Framework**: Continue with existing or adopt component library?
4. **Testing Strategy**: Manual vs. automated testing priority?
5. **Deployment Strategy**: Phased rollout or big bang?

### Resource Requirements
- **Frontend Developers**: Need 2-3 more immediately
- **UI/UX Designer**: Critical for component library
- **QA Engineer**: Need testing strategy and implementation
- **DevOps**: Need deployment pipeline setup
