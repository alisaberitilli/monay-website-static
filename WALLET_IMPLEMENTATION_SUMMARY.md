# Wallet Implementation Summary
## Enterprise vs Consumer - Invoice System Integration
**Date**: September 26, 2025

---

## 📂 Project Structure & Separation

### Enterprise Wallet
- **Directory**: `/monay-caas/monay-enterprise-wallet/`
- **Port**: 3007
- **Purpose**: Invoice creation, treasury management, business operations
- **Users**: Business admins, treasury managers, accounting teams

### Consumer Wallet
- **Directory**: `/monay-cross-platform/web/` (Web)
- **Directory**: `/monay-cross-platform/mobile/` (Mobile)
- **Port**: 3003 (Web)
- **Purpose**: Invoice payment, P2P transfers, consumer transactions
- **Users**: Individual consumers, invoice recipients

### ⚠️ CRITICAL SEPARATION RULES
1. **NO code sharing** between enterprise and consumer directories
2. **NO direct imports** across wallet boundaries
3. **ALL communication** through backend API (port 3001)
4. **Shared logic** must be duplicated, not referenced
5. **Database access** only through backend API

## 🎯 Key Functional Differences

### Enterprise Wallet (Creates)
| Feature | Purpose | Cost |
|---------|---------|------|
| **Treasury Setup** | One-time initialization | $50 |
| **Invoice Creation** | Tokenize on Solana | $0.00005 |
| **Provider Management** | Tempo ↔ Circle swaps | $0.001 |
| **On-Ramp** | Deposit fiat, mint tokens | Variable |
| **Off-Ramp** | Burn tokens, withdraw fiat | Variable |
| **Analytics** | Track payments, treasury | Free |

### Consumer Wallet (Pays)
| Feature | Purpose | Cost |
|---------|---------|------|
| **Invoice Reception** | View received invoices | Free |
| **Invoice Payment** | Pay with wallet balance | $0.0001 |
| **Partial Payments** | Pay in installments | $0.0001 each |
| **Credit Management** | Use overpayment credits | Free |
| **P2P Requests** | Request money from others | $0.00005 |
| **QR Payments** | Scan to pay | $0.0001 |

## 🔗 Shared Backend Services

Both wallets use these services through API:

### Treasury Service (`/src/services/enterprise-treasury.js`)
- **Enterprise Uses**: All functions
- **Consumer Uses**: `processInvoicePayment()` only

### Invoice Routes (`/src/routes/enterprise-treasury.js`)
- **Enterprise Access**: Full CRUD operations
- **Consumer Access**: Read and pay only

### Database Tables
- **Both Access**: Through API with role-based permissions
- **Enterprise Writes**: invoices, treasury, templates
- **Consumer Writes**: payments, requests, credits

## 📋 Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation
- **Enterprise**: Treasury setup, basic invoice creation
- **Consumer**: Invoice inbox, payment flow
- **Both**: API integration setup

### Week 2: Core Features
- **Enterprise**: Full invoice management, provider swaps
- **Consumer**: P2P requests, partial payments
- **Both**: Real-time updates via WebSocket

### Week 3: Advanced Features
- **Enterprise**: On/off ramp, analytics dashboard
- **Consumer**: Auto-pay, spending analytics
- **Both**: Mobile optimization

### Week 4: Polish & Testing
- **Enterprise**: Multi-sig, templates, reports
- **Consumer**: QR codes, notifications, offline
- **Both**: E2E testing, documentation

## 🚫 What NOT to Share

### Code/Components
- UI components (each wallet has own design system)
- State management (separate stores)
- Routing logic (different navigation patterns)
- Form validations (different requirements)

### What CAN be Duplicated
- Type definitions (with modifications)
- Utility functions (date formatting, etc.)
- API client setup (with different endpoints)
- Error handling patterns

## ✅ Implementation Checklist

### Before Starting
- [ ] Review both TODO lists completely
- [ ] Ensure backend is running (port 3001)
- [ ] Verify database tables exist
- [ ] Confirm API routes are registered

### Enterprise Wallet First
- [ ] Start with treasury initialization UI
- [ ] Test invoice creation flow
- [ ] Verify Solana integration
- [ ] Implement payment tracking

### Consumer Wallet Second
- [ ] Start with invoice inbox
- [ ] Test payment flow
- [ ] Verify credit handling
- [ ] Implement P2P requests

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Create invoice in Enterprise
- [ ] Pay invoice from Consumer
- [ ] Verify credit creation on overpayment
- [ ] Test P2P request flow
- [ ] Validate treasury balances

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Enterprise Wallet
- Multi-signature for large operations
- Role-based access (Admin, Treasury, Viewer)
- Audit logging for all operations
- IP whitelisting for treasury ops

### Consumer Wallet
- Biometric/PIN for payments
- Transaction limits based on KYC
- Fraud detection on patterns
- Device fingerprinting

### Both
- JWT authentication
- API rate limiting
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Webhook signature verification

- Invoice creation < 2 seconds
- Payment reconciliation 100% accurate
- Zero treasury discrepancies

### Consumer Success
- Payment completion < 2 seconds
- Zero failed legitimate payments
- Credit application 100% accurate
- P2P request success > 95%

## 🎉 End Result

When complete, users will experience:

1. **Enterprise Creates Invoice** → Tokenized on Solana ($0.00005)
2. **Consumer Receives Notification** → Invoice appears in inbox
3. **Consumer Pays Invoice** → Atomic payment on Solana (<100ms)
4. **Enterprise Receives Payment** → Instant settlement
5. **Both See Updated Status** → Real-time via WebSocket

**Total Cost**: $0.00015 per invoice lifecycle
**Total Time**: <2 seconds end-to-end

---

**Remember**: Keep the codebases separate, communicate only through the API, and maintain clear boundaries between enterprise and consumer functionality.
