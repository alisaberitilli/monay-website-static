## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK - Production Blockers
1. **No Stablecoin Issuer** - Cannot operate without Circle/Paxos
2. **No Custodian** - Cannot hold customer assets
3. **No Banking Partner** - Cannot manage USD reserves
4. **No MSB License** - Legal/regulatory violation risk

### MEDIUM RISK - Operational Issues
1. Incomplete KYC integration
2. Missing sanctions screening
3. No 24/7 operations center
4. Limited disaster recovery

### LOW RISK - Growth Limitations
1. Single stablecoin option
2. Limited international support
3. Manual reconciliation processes

## Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (This Week)
1. **Contact Circle** for USDC partnership application
2. **Engage BitGo** for custody discussions
3. **Apply to Evolve Bank** or Cross River Bank
4. **Hire Compliance Counsel** for MSB registration
5. **Begin SOC 2 Type II** preparation

### ALTERNATIVE APPROACH
If obtaining Permitted Payment Stablecoin Issuer status proves challenging:

1. **Partner Model**: White-label Circle's infrastructure
2. **Broker Model**: Act as agent for existing issuer
3. **Hybrid Model**: Issue tokens backed by USDC reserves
4. **Acquisition**: Acquire entity with existing licenses

## Conclusion

The Monay Enterprise Wallet platform has **strong technical capabilities** and comprehensive feature implementation. However, **it cannot go to production** without:

1. ‚úÖ Circle or Paxos stablecoin partnership
2. ‚úÖ Qualified custodian agreement
3. ‚úÖ FDIC-insured banking relationship
4. ‚úÖ MSB registration completion
5. ‚úÖ Reserve attestation framework

**Estimated Timeline to Production**: 12-16 weeks after initiating partnerships

**Estimated Budget Required**: $2.5-3.5M (including first year operations)

**Recommendation**: Begin partnership discussions immediately, focusing on Circle, BitGo, and a banking partner. Consider partnering with an already-licensed entity to accelerate time to market while pursuing independent licenses.
